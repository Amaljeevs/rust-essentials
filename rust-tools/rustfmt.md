# Rustfmt

Rustfmt is a tool for formatting Rust code according to the official Rust style guidelines. It helps maintain consistent and readable code across different projects and developers.

## Installation

Rustfmt is typically installed as a part of the Rust toolchain. If you have Rust installed, you likely already have Rustfmt available. To check if it's installed, you can run the following command:

```bash
$ rustfmt --version
```
If Rustfmt is not installed, you can install it using the Cargo package manager by running the following command:

```bash
$ cargo install rustfmt
```
### Basic Usage
To format a Rust source file using Rustfmt, navigate to the directory containing the file and run the following command:

```bash
$ rustfmt <file_name>.rs
```
This command will format the specified Rust file according to the Rust style guidelines and update the file in place.

By default, Rustfmt uses the standard Rust style configuration. However, you can customize the formatting rules by creating a .rustfmt.toml file in your project directory or the parent directories. This file allows you to override or customize specific formatting options.

### Integrating with Editors
Rustfmt integrates well with various text editors and integrated development environments (IDEs), providing automatic code formatting while you write code. Here are some popular editor integrations:

Visual Studio Code: Install the Rust extension and enable the "Format on Save" option.
IntelliJ IDEA: Install the Rust plugin and enable the "Reformat Code on File Save" option.
Sublime Text: Install the Rust Enhanced package and configure it to format on save.
Atom: Install the Rust package and enable the "Format On Save" option.
Refer to the documentation or community resources for specific instructions on setting up Rustfmt with your preferred editor.

### Configuration
Rustfmt offers various configuration options that allow you to customize the formatting behavior. You can create a .rustfmt.toml file in your project directory or the parent directories to specify these options. The official Rustfmt documentation provides detailed information on available configuration options and their usage.
