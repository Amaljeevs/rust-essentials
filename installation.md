# Installation

To get started with Rust programming, you'll need to install the Rust programming language on your machine. The installation process varies slightly depending on your operating system. Follow the instructions below based on your OS:

## Windows

1. Visit the official Rust website: [https://www.rust-lang.org/](https://www.rust-lang.org/)

2. Click on the "Install" button, which will take you to the Rust installation page.

3. Download the Rust installation executable for Windows.

4. Run the downloaded executable and follow the installation wizard.

5. Accept the license agreement, choose the default installation options, and select the components you want to install. By default, the Rust installer will install the Rust compiler (`rustc`), the build tool and package manager `Cargo`, and other necessary components.

6. After installation, open a new command prompt or PowerShell window and type `rustc --version` to verify that Rust is installed correctly. You should see the Rust version number printed.

## macOS and Linux

1. Open a terminal on your macOS or Linux machine.

2. Visit the official Rust website: [https://www.rust-lang.org/](https://www.rust-lang.org/)

3. In the terminal, copy and paste the following command, and press Enter to start the installation process:

curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

4. The command above will download a script and start the Rust installation process. Follow the prompts in the terminal to proceed with the installation.

5. During the installation, you'll be asked to proceed with the default installation, customize the installation, or perform advanced setup. Choose the desired option based on your preferences.

6. Once the installation is complete, close and reopen the terminal to ensure the changes take effect.

7. To verify that Rust is installed correctly, open a new terminal window and run the command `rustc --version`. You should see the Rust version number displayed.

Congratulations! You've successfully installed Rust on your machine. You're now ready to start writing Rust programs and exploring the language's features.
