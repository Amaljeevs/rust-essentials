## Introduction

Rust is a modern, safe, and high-performance systems programming language known for its focus on memory safety, concurrency, and expressive syntax. In this repository, we'll explore the fundamental concepts of Rust and provide practical examples to help you grasp the language's unique features.

## Installation

To get started with Rust, you'll need to install the Rust programming language on your machine. Follow the instructions below based on your operating system:

- [Windows](installation.md#windows)
- [macOS](installation.md#macos)
- [Linux](installation.md#linux)

## Rust Tools

Rust provides a set of powerful tools that enhance your development experience. In this section, we'll cover the following tools:

- rustc: The Rust compiler
- Cargo: The package manager and build tool for Rust
- rustfmt: The code formatter for Rust

Learn how to set up and use these tools effectively to compile, manage dependencies, and format your Rust code.

## Variables

Variables are an essential concept in any programming language. In Rust, variables have unique characteristics due to the ownership and borrowing system. In this section, we'll cover variable declaration, scoping rules, and the concept of variable shadowing in Rust.

## Input from Console

Interacting with users through the console is a common task in many applications. Learn how to read input from the console using Rust's standard input/output library, `std::io`.

## Arithmetic and Type Casting

Performing arithmetic operations and type casting are fundamental tasks in programming. Explore how to perform basic arithmetic operations in Rust and handle type conversions when necessary.

## Functions

Functions are the building blocks of any program. Discover how to define and use functions in Rust, including passing parameters, returning values, and distinguishing between function expressions and statements.

## Memory Management

Rust's ownership model allows for efficient memory management while ensuring safety and preventing memory-related bugs. Dive into Rust's memory management concepts, including the stack and the heap, and understand how Rust handles memory allocation and deallocation.
